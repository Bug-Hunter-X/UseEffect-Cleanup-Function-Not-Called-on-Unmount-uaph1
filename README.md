# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue where the cleanup function within a `useEffect` hook in React might not be called correctly on component unmount.  This can occur under specific conditions, often related to fast component updates or premature unmounting before the cleanup function has a chance to execute.

The issue is detailed in `bug.js`, and a potential solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  The solution focuses on addressing potential race conditions or scenarios that might prevent proper cleanup.
